# Local dev instructions
1. Run `npm i` from this dir to install packages
2. Run `yarn start` from this dir to open expo bundler + dev tools
3. Follow terminal instructions to open in web, iOS or Android respectively

Note that Android Studio and XCode must be installed on your machine. Expo can spin up iOS emulator from the command line. However, Android emulator must be manually started from Android Studio before Expo CLI can talk to it.

Instructions for setting up android emulator can be found [here](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)

I also needed to sign in with my google account in the android emulator in order for Expo app to work
